Scripts used in the analysis of Island Thrush for Reeve et al. 2022 (to appear).

These are divided into

* `sex_linkage/` - scripts used to identify sex-linked contigs,
* `bioinformatics_and_analysis/` - the things I ran on compute servers
(e.g. large output files or long run times), and
* `plotting_scripts/` things I ran on my laptop (almost all plotting scripts).
